- Import emails and Telegram messages to Nastenka by forwarding them, with support for additional content types in the future.
- Skip browser extensions or mobile apps, just forward messages to a Telegram bot or special email address.
- Organize any Pins into Investigations, which are like boards or folders.
- Move Pins around in Investigations to set their importance by dragging them.
- Keep your content private by using Nastenka on your own server and connecting it with your own Telegram bot and email account.

## Setup

- Create a new Telegram bot by messaging [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
- Create a new email account or alias that you will use to forward emails to Nastenka. Your email provider must support [plus addressing](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360060591053-Plus-addressing-and-subdomain-addressing).
- Create a new folder in your email account for Nastenka, and set up rules for automatically moving relevant emails into it. Nastenka uses separate email addresses for each Investigation and they are all in the format `alias+UUID@example.com` where `UUID` is the ID of the Investigation.
- Setup Nastenka on your server using Docker Compose. See the [example docker-compose.yml](/example-docker-compose.yml) for an example configuration. You will need to set up a Postgresql database, a Minio S3-compatible object storage service, and a reverse proxy (e.g. Caddy or Traefik) to handle routing to the frontend and backend servers.
- Create a new bucket in Minio for Nastenka, and set up a policy to allow public access to the bucket.
- Provide the necessary environment variables to the backend server.

**Environment variables:**

- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/nastenka` - The URL for connecting to the Postgresql database.
- `PORT=8080` - The internal port on which the backend server will run.
- `BOT_USER_ID` - Your Telegram user ID.

- `EMAIL_FOLDER=Nastenka` - Name of the folder in your email account where you should move emails from Nastenka. You should create this folder and set up rules for automatically moving relevant emails into it.
- `EMAIL_NASTENKA_ALIAS=nastenka@example.com` - The email address or alias that you will use to forward emails to Nastenka.
- `EMAIL_URL=imap://imap.fastmail.com:993` - The IMAP URL for accessing your email account.
- `AWS_REGION=us-east-1` - This should always be set to `us-east-1` for Minio.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS (Minio) access key ID.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS (Minio) secret access key.
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME=nastenka` - The name of the S3 bucket where Nastenka files will be stored.
- `S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000` - The endpoint URL for the S3-compatible API provided by the self-hosted Minio service.
